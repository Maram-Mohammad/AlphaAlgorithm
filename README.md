AlphaAlgorithm
==============

Java implementation of the Process Mining Alpha algorithm

This is an Eclipse project. Import as existing project, no setup required.
Java 7 is used, can be easily converted to Java 6, only a few lines require changing.

Can do:
  1. Parse an XES file into an Event Log
  2. Create a WF-net from that Event Log using the Alpha Plus Algorithm
  3. Run traces on the create WF-net
  4. Validate the created WF-net
  5. Eat candy
